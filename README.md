## Hi there 👋
I am Jinzhou Li, a PhD student in the Robot Dexterity Lab (DexLab) at Duke University, advised by Prof. Xianyi Cheng. My research focuses on dexterous robotic manipulation and multimodal learning. I like building full systems — sensors, teleoperation tools, control code, and learning models — and trying them on real robots to see what actually works.
